## About me

I am a senior lecturer in the Department of Computing in the Faculty of Science and Technoogy at the University of the West Indies.
My research has been in the areas of data and software security and software engineering. My teaching has also focused on these areas
and introductory courses in programming. In 2021 I documented some lecture notes from the many clasees and discussions I have had on
introductory programming and I have made the document available here. It is freely available and registered under a Creative Common Licence.
