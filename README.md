- 👋 Hi, I’m Curtis Busby-Earle. I'm a senior lecturer in the department of computing at the University of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica.
     In my department I typically deliver courses in introductory programming, and software security at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
     My research has primarily been in the field of data and software security and secondarily in requirements engineering.
- 👀 I’m interested in data and software security, software engineering and quantum computing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can on quantum computing and, its potential in computer security
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the fields I mentioned I'm interested in or other related fields
- 📫 You can reach me at curtis.busbyearle@uwimona.edu.jm
