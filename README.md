- 👋 Hi, I’m Curtis Busby-Earle. I'm a senior lecturer in the department of computing at the University of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica.
     In my department I have delivered courses in introductory programming, and software security at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The courses that I now deliver are focused on software security and quantum computing. 
     My research has primarily been in the fields of data and software security, requirements engineering and most recently quantum computing.
- 👀 I’m interested in data and software security, software engineering and quantum computing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can on quantum computing and, its potential use and impact in computer security.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the fields I mentioned but also in other related fields.
